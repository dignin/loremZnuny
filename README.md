# loremZnuny
A script to pipe test mails into a Znuny Instance for Testing

To use just download the script to your application directory. You can make the script executable, or run it with ``bash rand_mail.sh 1`` The only parameter is the number of mails to generate. It will create a nice mail with a lorem ipsum style. Great for demos. Edit and add other headers for Postmaster Filter Testing, or any other thinkable use case.

Remember, ~~to ((enjoy)) and~~ Happy Hacking!!
